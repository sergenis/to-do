TO DO list with context which looks like redux.
Because it's so many peoples like flux or asking about useless redux.

In this test task i have created to do list which may be haven't cool design,
but it full of pretty cool by features.

P.S. Created in ~4 hours so mobile version not provided.
I'm to lazy to create it.

P.S.S. I know about these is not best ways to solve these issues... In most cases.
But my mind, the test task is needed to show that in general you can do.
